Step 1: 
Use the vulnerable source code at the end of the assignment. Compile it with: 
gcc ./vuln_program.c -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -static -o vuln_program

Step 2: Disable protections on your VM (use a 32 bit VM)

To make your job easier, you should disable address space layout randomization (ASLR). On Ubuntu-based systems, run the following command:

sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0

If you are working on a RedHat-based system (e.g., RHE or Fedora), you will also need to disable Execshield, as follows:

sudo sysctl -w kernel.exec-shield=0

Step 3: Crash the program.

Run the program vuln_program and provide a long input to cause it to crash. How long an input do you need? You can use the source code to analyze why that makes sense. You may also want to use "objdump -D ./vuln_program" or gdb to figure it out.

This article may be of help: Examining a Buffer Overflow in C and assembly with gdb. You may also find this gdb cheat sheet helpful (http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/GDB-Commands.html).

Step 4: Exploit the overflow

Now that you understand what's going on, write an exploit that, instead of causing a crash, causes the program to print out "Haha! You got pwned!". There's an existing function target in the executable that prints this. So all you need to do is use the buffer overflow to overwrite return address on the stack to point to target's address.

In your program, you will need to write a separate program to generate the attack string into a file, say, "attack.input". You then run the program as "./vuln-program < ./attack.input" to see whether you can exploit the code to print "I am sorry that you just got pwned!" without crashing the program.
